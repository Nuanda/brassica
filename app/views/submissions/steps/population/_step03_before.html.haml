    One possibility to define plant Lines related to this population is to upload information
    in a CSV file. This is especially suitable for cases when a lot of plant lines have to be
    submitted.

  %p
    The <b>Species</b> column should provide the taxonomy name for a given line (e.g. "B. napus"). The
    <b>Plant variety</b> column should name the plant variety of which the given plant line is.
    You are welcome to use
    = succeed ',' do
      = link_to 'plant varieties currently defined in BIP', data_tables_path(model: 'plant_varieties'), target: '_blank'
    or, in case the relevant varieties are
    absent, to create your own. Any plant variety submitted in the CSV document, which is not
    found inside BIP, will be created as a new plant variety table record. In such a case, the
    following column value of <b>Crop type</b> is set as the new plant variety crop type property.

  %p
    Following five columns characterise the plant line itself:
    %ul
      %li the <b>Plant line</b> column value is required, it should provide the name of the line, and it should be unique to each submitted plant line
      %li <b>Common name</b> (optional) - a name that is widely recognized by the breeder community
      %li <b>Previous line name</b> (optional) - the old name of the plant line, if it was changed
      %li
        <b>Genetic status</b> (optional) - the name of the design method used to obtain this
        line (i.e. open pollinated, inbred, substitution lines)
      %li
        <b>Sequence</b> (optional) - an identifier of the line sequence, in an external database,
        like NCBI SRA; identifiers starting with SR will be automatically recognized as SRA submissions.

  %p
    Further set of three columns pertains to <b>plant accession</b> information. Each new, submitted
    plant line should be (though it isn't strictly required by the submission wizard) related to
    a plant accession entry. This entry is defined by three elements:
    %ul
      %li
        %b Plant accession
        which names the accession (use the unique accession identification from your organisation, e.g. Notthm_BnASSYST_001)
      %li
        %b Originating organisation
        which names the organisation which named this accession (e.g. Nottingham)
      %li
        %b Year produced
        which sets the year of the accession (e.g. 2012).

    If you provide the plant accession information, you are <i>required to supply values for all three
    columns</i>. Also, your organisation should ensure the unique naming of accession - so you never
    duplicate the <b>Plant accession</b> value in the context of the same <b>Originating organisation</b>.

  %p
    For your convenience please use
    %b
      = link_to 'the ready template', '/manuals/plant_lines_template.csv'
    in a CSV format. Please download it, leave the header (the first line) intact, and paste your data, in columns,
    below the header (thus replacing the placeholder <code>... - replace it</code> values). Please do not remove
    columns even if you do not submit any values for them.
