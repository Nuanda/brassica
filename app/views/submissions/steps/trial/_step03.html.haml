              Please use the button next to this text to download a trait scoring sheet template in XLS format. The template has been created
              according to the choices you have made so far in this submission. If you see that the headers donâ€™t correspond
              to the data you want to submit, navigate back to previous submission steps and amend them accordingly.
              An altered template can then be downloaded at this step.

        %h5 Trait scoring sheet structure
        %p
          The next step requires you to upload a file with scoring values. The required format is simple and features
          %b unique plant scoring unit identification column
          (please go back to step 2 for a short definition of a plant scoring unit), followed by
          - if design_factor_names.present?
            %b #{design_factor_names.size} column(s) for design factors
            selected in the previous step and
          %b 3 column(s) for plant accession information
          (accession id, accession assigning organisation and year it was produced - see below),
          %b another column with plant #{pl_pv_name} name
          (also explained below) and
          %b trait scores
          (including potential technical replicate scores) in further columns.
          The number of columns depends on

        %ul
          %li how many <b>traits</b> you selected in the second step of this submission,
          %li how many <b>design factors</b> you defined in the third step (raw data only),
          %li how many <b>technical replicates</b> you plan to submit (raw data only).

        %p
          Sticking to this template should guarantee correct parsing of score values when you upload the file. Please,
          paste your data, in columns, below the header (thus replacing the placeholder <code>... - replace it</code>
          values).

        - column_letters = ("A".."Z").to_a

        %h5 Plant accession information
        %p
          Accession-related fields (<b>Plant accession</b> identifier -
          in column <b>#{column_letters[design_factor_names.size + 2]}</b>, the <b>Originating organisation</b>
          which issued this accession number - in column <b>#{column_letters[design_factor_names.size + 3]}</b>,
          and the <b>Year produced</b> - in column <b>#{column_letters[design_factor_names.size + 4]}</b> are mandatory.
          If you do not have an Accession defined for your plants, please create one yourself (for example,
          using <code>#{'<institute_name>_<seedbag_id>'}</code>).
          It will serve as a placeholder identifier for the unique genetic material used in your trials.
          Accordingly, it is important that you are able to relate back to the identifier when cross-linking
          with the corresponding genetic data.

        %h5 Plant #{pl_pv_name} column
        %p
          This column is especially important if you <b>submit new accessions</b> (i.e. ones which are not present
          in BIP). Every such new accession will be recorded in BIP and it will be related to a <b>plant #{pl_pv_name}</b>.

          - if pl_pv_name == 'line'
            If there are new plant lines created in the course of your experiment, or if you are using existing
            plant lines which are not present in BIP at the moment, we request that you submit these
            new plant lines first, using the
            = succeed '.' do
              = link_to 'Plant population submission procedure', new_submission_path, target: '_blank'
            Afterwards you will be able to return to this step and proceed with trial data submission
            (to save your draft submission, click the <b>Save & edit later</b> button).

          - else
            If you are using plant varieties (cultivars) which are not listed in BIP, please provide their names
            in column <b>#{column_letters[design_factor_names.size + 4]}</b>. These names will then be recorded in BIP as new
            plant varieties related to your plant accession.

        %p
          - if pl_pv_name == 'line'
            For the list of plant lines currently registered in BIP, you may
            = succeed '.' do
              = link_to 'consult this data table', data_tables_path(model: 'plant_lines'), target: '_blank'
            Please use the values from the <b>Line name</b> column when referring to existing plant lines
            in your XLS file in order to avoid duplications due to differences in spelling..

          - else
            If you are using plant varieties (cultivars) known to BIP, you may
            = link_to 'consult this data table', data_tables_path(model: 'plant_varieties'), target: '_blank'
            in order to find their names.
            Please use the values from the <b>Variety</b> column when referring to existing plant varieties
            in your XLS file in order to avoid duplications due to differences in spelling.

        %h5 Trait scores ordering #{'and technical replicates' if rep_traits.present?}
        %p
          The first line will be treated as a header. Specific values in columns
          <b>#{column_letters[design_factor_names.size + 6]}</b> and further will be treated as scoring for the
          trait whose name matches the corresponding column header. If no match is found, the score will
          be stored by column index. That is, an unmatched column <b>#{column_letters[design_factor_names.size + 7]}</b>
          header will cause all column <b>#{column_letters[design_factor_names.size + 7]}</b>
          values to be treated as scores for the second trait (in the order of input)
          - if rep_traits.present?
            , or the second technical replicate of the first trait,
          defined during the first step of this submission.
          Please <b>be careful when pasting your trait scores beneath the correct headers</b>
          as they may not appear in the order they are recorded in your source spreadsheet.

        - if rep_traits.present?
          %p
            Scoring for technical replicates should be submitted in trait-rep order. For instance, for
            #{rep_traits[0][1]} technical replicates of #{rep_traits[0][0]} scores, the column with values
            measured for the second technical replicate should directly follow the column with scores for
            the first technical replicate (no other trait scores in between).

        %p
          In order to avoid any ordering related issues, <b>please use the XLS template</b>
          provided to you above - this template's header has all trait name
          - if rep_traits.present?
            and technical replicate
          columns in the proper order.

          The template includes several environment properties as defined by
          the #{link_to "MIAPPE", "http://www.miappe.org/", target: "_blank"} standard.
          Most of these properties can be described by providing single numerical value and corresponding
          unit.

        %p
          There are some exceptions (<i>Type of lamps used</i>, <i>Container type</i>, <i>Rooting medium</i>)
          which do not follow this rule and require choice of an item from drop-down list (orange field) with
          optional description (yellow field). Entering new value instead of using drop-down list is also acceptable.
          More than one value can be provided by using subsequent columns.

        %p
          Finally, <i>pH</i> is another exception as it requires to provide pH value (orange field) at
          corresponding depth range (yellow field). Subsequent columns can be used to describe pH at
          different depths.

          For each category you can describe what treatments were applied by providing:

        %ul
          %li name of the treatment (orange field)
          %li detailed description (yellow field, optional).

        There is no limit for the number of treatments you can include for each category. If possible, please select
        treatment name from the provided drop-down list. However, if required term cannot be found you can enter
        any name and it will be added to the database.
