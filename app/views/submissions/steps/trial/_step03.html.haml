    The BIP service assumes that each row in the trait scoring sheet, that you are going to submit,
    represents a so-called <b>plant scoring unit</b>. For raw data it may simply be an individual
    plant in your experiment. For processed data a plant scoring unit may represent a set of plants,
    related to each other in some way. It is mandatory to provide plant accession information
    for each plant scoring unit in the scoring sheet to be submitted.

  %p
    In case you would like to check what plant accessions are currently registered in the BIP, please use the
    = link_to 'plant accessions table view', data_tables_path(model: 'plant_accessions'), target: '_blank'
    (you may filter data in that table with the <b>Search</b> text field).

  %p
    If you submit raw data, you will have an option to submit technical replicate readings as
    well as design factors (for instance, ordinal numbers for plots, reps and so forth).

      Per each plant scoring unit submitted, the source of genetic material should be provided.
      It may either be a <b>plant line</b> or a <b>plant variety (cultivar)</b>.
      This choice depends on the type of experiment you are conducting. You should select
      the <b>Plant lines</b> option if you
      %ul
        %li created new genetic material (using, for instance, crossing or mutagenesis) in the course of your project,
        %li or you use former plant line genetic material which is not (yet) recognized as a variety or a cultivar.
      In other cases you should probably select the the <b>Plant varieties</b> option.

        Please select the appropriate statistical design factors suitable for your experimental setup from
        the drop-down fields. Start by selecting the <b>highest design factor first</b>
        and proceed with the next ones in <b>decreasing</b> size.

      %p
        If your factors are not present in the list provided, please add them manually. While creating new
        factors, please make sure you comply with the rule to submit them in decreasing size, so with the
        highest missing factor (e.g. treatment) first, to lowest missing factor (e.g. plot).
        You are able to mix both predefined factors, from the drop-down list, and your own factor names.
