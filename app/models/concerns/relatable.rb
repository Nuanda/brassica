# Single Concern for all models that relate to others
# in DataTables through 'count' columns.
# For each this_model.has_many :m (with model M) you'd like to relate to, you should:
#  - add ms_count column to this_models table (in migrations)
#  - add "counter_cache: true" to M.belongs_to this_model declaration
#  - add 'ms_count' string to self.count_columns below
#  - include Filterable in M
#  - add 'this_models.id' to M.permitted_params for :query hash
