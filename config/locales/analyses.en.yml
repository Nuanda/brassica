          all_mutations_removed: All mutations were excluded from analysis due to lack of variability between samples.
          all_traits_removed: All traits were excluded from analysis due to lack of variability between samples.
          all_samples_removed: All samples were excluded from analysis because of no overlap between genotype and phenotype data.
          shell_job_error: The analysis failed. Please, consult 'Std error' and 'Std output' for more information.
