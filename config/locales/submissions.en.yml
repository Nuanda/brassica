      population: |
        The following process allows you to submit a detailed description of your
        Brassica population. Apart from species information you may indicate
        the parent Brassica lines and the list of (possibly new) plant lines
        connected with this population.
      trial: |
        With Trail submission you are able to upload new trait scoring information to BIP.
        The process lets you describe trial conditions and environment, to indicate
        what traits were scored and how, and finally to upload the list of scoring.

        step03:
          heading: Plant lines.
          body: |
            Define the list of plant lines connected with the submitted population.
            You can either use the CSV file template (suitable for larger populations) or manual form submission.
        step04:
          heading: Provenance.
          body: Identify the owner of the submitted data and describe its provenance.
      trial:
        step01:
          heading: Trial information.
          body: Provide detailed description about the performed plant trial. Give as much information as possible.
        step02:
          heading: Traits.
          body: Choose plant traits that were scored in the course of this trial, or define new trait descriptors.
          new_trait_descriptor_attributes:

          heading: Scoring template design.
          body: |
            Provide us with information important for the scoring template design. The template will then be created
            automatically, in order to help you upload your trait data correctly.
        step04:
          heading: Scoring.
          body: Upload tabular list of scores given to plants per each trait scored.
        step05:
          heading: Trial layout.
